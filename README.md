## Releases

* The main branch is the current release and is considered stable at all
  times.
* New versions can be released as frequently as every two weeks (our sprint
  cycle). The only exception would be for a high priority patch.
* All active work is flagged with the sprint milestone and tracked in the
  project dashboard.
* New releases occur the day after the sprint finishes.
  * The version in the dev branch is updated
  * The changes are merged into main
  * A new tag is created

## Contributions

* All pull requests must be made against the dev branch, direct commits to
  main are not permitted.
* All non trivial contributions should start with an issue being filed (if it is
  a new feature please propose your design/approach before doing any work as not
  all feature requests are accepted).
